# Playground

Draft repository for a playground web application for Pendulum

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Before running

Make sure to set the envorinment variables :

- `process.env.REACT_APP_FAUCET_MNEMONIC_SEED` variable for the faucet mnemonic

- `process.env.REACT_APP_ASSET_ISSUER_SECRET` for the USDC and EUR issuer secret

- `process.env.REACT_APP_AMM_ADDRESS` for the USDC and EUR issuer secret

## Run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Build

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
